# Hotel Booking Intelligence Dashboard

This project analyzes hotel booking data from 2015–2017 to uncover trends in booking demand, cancellation behavior, and revenue performance. The analysis is delivered through an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making in the hospitality industry.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview
The dashboard visualizes key business metrics including total revenue, average daily rate (ADR), booking trends, lead time distribution, customer segmentation, and cancellation rates. The insights are designed to help identify revenue opportunities, operational risks, and strategic improvement areas.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Google BigQuery**  
  Used as a cloud data warehouse to store, process, and query large-scale hotel booking data efficiently using SQL. BigQuery enables fast aggregation, transformation, and analysis of raw transactional data before visualization.

- **Google Looker Studio**  
  Used to build interactive dashboards and visualizations connected directly to BigQuery. Looker Studio transforms query results into clear charts, metrics, and filters that make insights accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- **SQL**  
  Used to clean, transform, and aggregate booking data, including calculations for ADR, cancellation rates, lead time, and revenue metrics.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Booking demand peaked in 2016 before declining in 2017, showing strong seasonal patterns  
- High cancellation rates indicate potential revenue leakage  
- City Hotel dominates total bookings, while Resort Hotel shows longer stay behavior  
- Online Travel Agencies (OTA) generate the largest share of bookings  

## 📈 Business Impact
This project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can be used to convert raw booking data into actionable insights that support pricing optimization, cancellation reduction, and revenue growth strategies.
